# Pineapple_Detection
Fine tuned model of YOLO v8s to detect ripe and unripe pineapples.

I have included the google colab file that trained the yolo model according to the datasets that i had.
Feel free to makes changes in the google colab notebook, include your datasets and fine tune the model accordingly.
The best.pt file that you'll get after training the model can be invoked inside main.py and can be used accordingly to detect your objects.
